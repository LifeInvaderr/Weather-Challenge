# How I started
With this project, I had started strong. I knew the API's that I needed as well as wanted to use. 
I first set up the project with the HTML and CSS, primarily using the BULMA framework as I prefer their framework to Bootstrap.

I then added Jquery and the code that would fetch the weather api.
I did this with relative ease, plugging and playing with the api

# What I had struggled with
With the previous lesson, I had problem after problem.
The first problem that I had faced was that I not only needed open weather api, I needed their one call as well. I found this out when I was placing in my UV index.
After implementing the One Call API, I then faced a challenge implementing Moment Timezone, as with the Timezone, I needed their cdn with data prefilled. I didn't realize this until hours later trying to trouble shoot.

Laslty, the problem that I face the most is with localstorage. With the challenge before, I was beginning to understand how localstorage works. I understand how to setItem, as well as to parse it, and to push it as an array.

However the most difficult challenge is adding them to clickable buttons, when updating localstorage. It only wants to update after the page has been refreshed.

# What I learned
With this challenge, I learned to pay extra attention to documentation, as well as the required API, as I over looked the One Call API statement when starting.

# What I hope to fix
I have spent far too much time with this project as of right now. I am planning to fix local storage as well as add the icons when I find the time.

I need to know when to cut my losses, and I believe I have gone far enough. As I need to catch up with the other modules.

I hope to comeback to this project and fix the issues.
